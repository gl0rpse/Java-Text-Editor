Java-Text-Editor


This was a program written by me and a classmate for a final project in our CPS150 Algorithms and Programming I class.
The function is very clear, as the program is a Java Text Editor. It utilizes the GUI system in Java to make the selection 
of files a more comfortable user experience while also incorporating multiple levels of user choice of what they'd like to do with the files.

Using ArrayLists as a starter for infinite lines in a txt.file, users can add lines of text(at the head of the file or the end), delete specific lines, and insert lines.
Users also get the choice of editing an already existing txt.file or creating an entirely new one to add text to.

We wanted it to be as cozy looking as possible while also being completely functional.
